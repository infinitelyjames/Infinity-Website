          Bob Speech-To-Text 
        </summary>
        <p class="detail-text">A 2016 Raspberry Pi project designed to create a computational virtual assistant. It was comprised of a variety of features, and eventually retired when more 
          alternatives came to the market. It was never publically distributed and was designed solely for Linux.

          Discord Music Bot
        </summary>
        <p class="detail-text">
          Started in 2020, this was a separate bot to the main Discord Bot. After recoding, it was integrated into the main bot for ~ 2 months, before being removed under a new host, 
          with different bandwidth charges. After being recoded and tested, a day before scheduled publication it was cancelled in awake of the Groovy takedown. To this day, it stands 
          archived in the bot's code, for owner use only.

          Python Auto-Format & Auto-Indent
        </summary>
        <p class="detail-text">
          This quirky script will solve the error, "inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation", and will also make all the indentation the same throughout 
          (you can choose which indentation length touse). In short, it neatens your code through normalising indentation.

          I'm not a robot / Recaptcha Solver
        </summary>
        <p class="detail-text">
          As the title suggests, it solves "I'm not a robot" challenges as a robot. It screenshots the display, builds a simple dataset quickly before the Recaptcha times out, analyses 
          the colour distribution throughout the images. This is designed for a specific type of Recaptcha, so doesn't work best on all.
